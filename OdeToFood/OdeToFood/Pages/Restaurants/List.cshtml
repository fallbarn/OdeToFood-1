@* sle note: gets _Layout.cshtml from _ViewStart.cshtml - this is by default *@
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Restaurants";

<h1>Restaurants</h1>

@*sle note: the special 'asp-for' tag replaces and combines the  'value and name' when used with bind parameters (Course 3.6)*@

    <div class="form-group">
        <div class="input-group">
            <input type="search" class="form-control"
                   asp-for="SearchTerm" />
            <span class="input-group-btn">
                <button class="btn btn-default">
                    <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></i>
                </button>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</form>



@*sle note: notice how the @ gives access to C# blocks. and when placed in front of a string the data is simply output into html.
    for example, in the code below, '@restaurant.name' would write the resturant's name onto the page.*@

@foreach (var restaurant in Model.Restaurants)
{
    // sle note: the below VS special html calls a partial view, found in
    // the same directory, called _Summary.cshtml. By convention (not enforced) partial
    // views prepended with '_'.
    // Note: 'var restaurant' is passed as a parameter (then becomes the Model);
    // _Summary.cshtml must have @using OdeToFood.Core and @model Restaurant to find the Type.
    <partial name="_Summary" model="restaurant" />
}
